Gesture Controlled Home Automation System

Description:

A gesture controlled system which controls the home appliances with use of gestures and uses the electricity usage data of devices to predict the electrivity consumption.

-Developed a gesture controlled glove using Flex Sensors and Arduino Microcontroller, which uniquely interprets the gesture and controls the household devices.

-Analyzing the usage of devices, built an Electricity Bill Prediction model using RNN and LSTM and trained it on a large dataset.

-Designed an user interface using Ajax and Php to dynamically display the device status and its power consumption.

Technologies Used: IoT, Machine Learning
